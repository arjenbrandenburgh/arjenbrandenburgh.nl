          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I'm a seasoned and versatile
          <strong>fullstack engineer and consultant</strong> with
          {{ xpYears }} years of professional experience. I have experience in
          building large web scale applications and smaller projects in and with
          international teams and cultures. I worked mostly in the financial
          sector, and proficient in all things <strong>JavaScript</strong>. In
          my leisure time, I like to experiment with new languages and
          frameworks. Currently living in <strong>Amsterdam</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my most succesful leisure-time projects is
          <a href="https://www.mtgstocks.com">MTGStocks</a>, which I
          <strong>founded</strong>, built and developed to track second hand
          market prices of <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> cards. The application
          tracks prices daily and uses statistical algorithms to detect trends
          to indicate which cards are solid investments and which should be
          sold. Currently, the site attracts over
          <strong>10.000 unique visitors</strong> daily.
